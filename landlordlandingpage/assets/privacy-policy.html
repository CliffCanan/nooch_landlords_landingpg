                        <h3 class="text-center" style="margin-top:10px;">Nooch’s Privacy Pledge</h3>

						<p class="legalIntro">It is important that you feel your privacy is valued and protected with Nooch.  Your financial and personal identity should remain fully within your control.  This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, store, use, and protect the information you provide to us.  We will not, use, or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.  Contact our Privacy Department – <a href="mailto:privacy@nooch.com">privacy@nooch.com</a>  – with any concerns that you have.</p>

						<h3>The Application of Nooch’s Privacy Policy</h3>

						<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all information we collect though our website and mobile application. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Nooch does not own or control, or to individuals that Nooch does not employ or manage.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources.</p>

						<p>Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider information that cannot be used to identify a specific user as personal information.</p>

						<h3>Why Nooch Collects Information</h3>

						<p>Nooch uses information to analyze how our service is used, diagnose technical problems, maintain security, personalize content, remember information to help you efficiently access your account, and monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns. Nooch also uses and tracks content as required by state and federal law.</p>

						<p>When you use Nooch (including visiting the Nooch website, downloading the Nooch mobile application, and accessing any features contained therein)  we collect the following:  your IP address, your web log information, your browser type, the pages you accessed on our website, geographic information in connection with any of the above.  Nooch reserves the right to anonymously track a user's activity within the mobile application (this does not include tracking or transmitting any personal or bank account information.)</p>

						<p>If you open an account, we collect the following types of information from you:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Account Information - your name, address, phone number, email, device ID and other similar information.</li>
							<li>Social Web Information - including your Facebook connect credentials and information that you authorize Facebook to share with us. If you authorize and provide it to us, we may also collect information concerning email contacts and other social web information. To help you connect to friends and contacts with whom you may want to use our service (as well as to improve our services and fight fraud), we also allow you to import data from other social web services.  We will only collect and utilize that information you have already authorized pursuant to your agreements with other social web services.</li>
							<li>Financial Information - bank account and routing numbers linked to your Nooch account. Nooch does not share financial information with any third party company (except Nooch's authorized financial services partner for ACH processing) or social networking services such as those listed in the prior bullet.  Nooch will comply with all applicable federal law when accepting this information.  This includes, but is not limited to, that which is required by the Bank Secrecy Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the PATRIOT Act, and the Dodd-Frank Act.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Nooch is committed to providing a secure, efficient and reliable service. Therefore, before permitting you to use our service, we may require additional information we can use to verify your identity and personal information or to manage risk, such as your date of birth, social security number, driver’s license number, home address, security questions or other information. We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as credit bureaus and identity verification services.</p>
						<p>When you use Nooch, we collect information about your account transactions and we may collect information about your computer or other access device for fraud prevention purposes. To process your payments on Nooch, we need to share some of your personal information, such as your name and/or email address with the user you transact with.</p>
						<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through Nooch.  In this case Nooch may not be able to provide certain services to you.  You may update or correct your account information and email preferences at any time by logging in to your account. We will not disclose your financial information, including any bank account information, to anyone you have paid or who has paid you through Nooch.  However, we may be required to do so in order to comply with a subpoena or other legal process.  In the interest of fraud prevention and as required by law, we may collect information about your account transactions, your geographic location, your access device, and other reasonable information helpful in ensuring the legality of Nooch transactions.  Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here.  For example, we may collect information related to your contact with our customer support team or store results when you respond to a survey.</p>
						<p>You can review and edit your personal information settings at any time by logging in to your account and navigating to the Account Settings section.</p>

						<h3>Information From Children</h3>

						<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Nooch does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 14 or knowingly allow such persons to register with the Service.  If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age 14 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information.</p>

						<h3>Nooch’s Use of Cookies</h3>

						<p>When you access our website, we, or companies we hire to track how our website is used, may place small data files called "cookies" on your computer.</p>

						<p>For example, we may send a "session cookie" to your device any time you log in to your Nooch account or visit our website. This type of cookie helps us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages on our site during the same session, so that we don't need to ask you for your password on each page. Once you log out or close your browser, this cookie expires and no longer has any effect.</p>

						<p>You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our services.</p>

						<h3>How We Protect and Store Personal Information</h3>

						<p>We store and process your personal information using third party servers located in secure data centers in the United States.  This information is protected by physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with applicable federal and state regulations. We also use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our office and files, and we authorize access to personal information only to those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.</p>

						<p>We make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. Despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee that personal information may not be hacked, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of our administrative, managerial and technical safeguards.  Therefore, we urge you to take adequate precautions to protect your personal data as well, including never sharing your Nooch password or PIN (personal identification number) with anyone.  Moreover, Nooch users should not store their password on their mobile device or computers.  In the event these devices are lost or stolen, Nooch will not be liable for unauthorized transfers where Nooch passwords were readily accessible on the device.</p>

						<p>If Nooch learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you by all means possible so that you can take appropriate protective steps.  By using the Nooch service, you agree that Nooch may communicate with you electronically.  Nooch may post a notice on our Website if a security breach occurs.  If this happens, you may need a web browser to view the website.  Nooch may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us.  Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice of a security breach) you should notify us.</p>

						<h3>Nooch’s Use of Personal Information</h3>

						<p>Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a secure, efficient, and seamless experience.  We may use your personal information to:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>provide the services and customer support you request;</li>
							<li>process transactions and send notices about your transactions or your network activity;</li>
							<li>resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems;</li>
							<li>prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement;</li>

							<li>compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties;</li>
							<li>comply with all relevant state and federal laws.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>We may use your email address to send you Nooch-related notices (including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail).  We may also use your contact information to send you marketing messages. If you do not want to receive such messages, you may opt out by following the instructions in the message. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses.  You can control receipt of certain Nooch messages in the Account Settings section of your account.</p>

						<p>You also provide us information as User Content that you post to Nooch. If you choose to invite a friend to the Service, we will ask you for that person's email address or phone number and automatically send an email or SMS invitation.  Nooch stores this information in order to send this email or SMS, to register your friend if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation feature.</p>

						<h3>How We Share Personal Information with other Nooch Users</h3>

						<p>To process your payments on Nooch, we need to share some of your personal information with the person or group that you are paying or is paying you. Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received and other verification metrics like social graph activity may be provided to users who you transact with on or through Nooch.</p>

						<p>We will not disclose your financial information, including bank account information, to anyone you have paid or who has paid you through Nooch, except with your express permission or if we are required to do so to comply with a subpoena or other legal process.</p>

						<h3>How We Share Personal Information with Other Parties</h3>

						<p>Nooch does not share your email address or phone number with third parties for promotional or marketing purposes.</p>

						<p>We may share your personal information with:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Your social web, when you request Nooch payments be posted to your social profiles. Your payments are always private by default. When you broadcast information to third party services, such information is no longer under the control of Nooch and is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of such third parties.
							<br><br>
							Nooch does not send your personal information to third party social networks unless you have requested or authorized us to do so</li>
							<li>Service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations; (for example, financial institutions, fraud prevention payment processing, technology services). Our contracts state that these service providers only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us and not for marketing or other purposes.</li>
							<li>Companies that we plan to merge with, be acquired by, or a bankruptcy estate. Should a merger or combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information could be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice and, if applicable, the opportunity to communicate preferences you may have.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order or similar legal procedure, when we need to do so to comply with the law we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our User Agreement, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
							<li>Other third parties with your express consent or direction.</li>
						</ul>
